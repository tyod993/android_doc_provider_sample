# android_doc_provider_sample
This app is a stripped down example of a DocumentsProvider on Andoroid. 
This should expose files to other applications to consume and allow for the user to manage
files using the device file manager.

Issue: Currently when a user running Android:30+ uses the files manager, the app is opened 
instead of allowing the user to manage the files.
